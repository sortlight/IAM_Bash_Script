#  Access Log Analyzer  
**Catch the intruders before they catch you slipping.**

###  Purpose

This little Bash beauty is my custom-built **Access Log Analyzer** ‚Äî a script designed to sniff out **failed login attempts** on a Linux system using `auth.log`.

Whether you're chasing down brute-force bots, testing security posture, or just learning how real-world log analysis works ‚Äî this script has your back like a mini SOC analyst on call üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

### What It Does

- ‚úÖ Scans `auth.log` (or any custom log) for failed SSH login attempts  
- ‚úÖ Parses out the **date**, **username**, and **IP address**  
- ‚úÖ Saves it neatly in `failed_logins.txt`  
- ‚úÖ Works even **offline** using the included `sample_auth.log`  
- ‚úÖ Makes you look smart and security-aware (facts)
