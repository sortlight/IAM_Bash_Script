# 📋 Access Log Analyzer  
**Catch the intruders before they catch you slipping.**

---

### 🔐 Purpose

This little Bash beauty is my custom-built **Access Log Analyzer** — a script designed to sniff out **failed login attempts** on a Linux system using `auth.log`.

Whether you're chasing down brute-force bots, testing security posture, or just learning how real-world log analysis works — this script has your back like a mini SOC analyst on call 🕵️‍♂️.

---

### 🚀 What It Does

- ✅ Scans `auth.log` (or any custom log) for failed SSH login attempts  
- ✅ Parses out the **date**, **username**, and **IP address**  
- ✅ Saves it neatly in `failed_logins.txt`  
- ✅ Works even **offline** using the included `sample_auth.log`  
- ✅ Makes you look smart and security-aware (facts)

### 🧠 What You'll Learn or Showcase

- Real Linux log parsing
- Using `grep` + `awk` for clean data extraction
- Understanding SSH brute-force attempts
- Creating simple SIEM-like tools with Bash
