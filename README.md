#  IAM Bash Scripts Portfolio  
**Automating trust, access and accountability ‚Äî one script at a time.**


---

##  Overview

This repository is a growing portfolio of **Bash scripts tailored for Identity and Access Management (IAM)**. It reflects my skills in Linux user management, access control, automation, auditing and cloud security.

Each script solves a real-world IAM problem starting from onboarding new users securely to scanning for risky permissions and even detecting access anomalies.

But more than that, it reflects my **approach to tech with intention, precision and personal purpose**.

##  Why IAM?

Identity is the **new perimeter** in modern security. Whether you‚Äôre managing Linux servers, deploying smart contracts, or building Web3 bots ‚Äî controlling *who has access* to *what* is everything.

This repo demonstrates how I:
- Automate **onboarding and offboarding**
- Implement **least privilege**
- Analyze **access events**
- Enforce **security policy with Bash**
